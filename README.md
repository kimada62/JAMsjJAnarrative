## Background
Many Japantowns have been subject to unfair eminent domain and target for redevelopment for financial purposes, causing only three Japantowns to be left in the U.S. This has caused many valuable history and personal stories to be completely erased with no traces. The San Jose Japantown is one of the remaining three Japantowns in the country. JAMsj is a museum in San Jose Japantown that exhibits artifacts and stories of Asian Americans, with an emphasis on the Japanese American narrative. With the museum being smaller than a lot of other Japanese museums like JANIM, voices have been raised whether they have been successful in representing the whole Japanese American experience.
## Main Objectives
We plan to preserve and uplift cultural memories related to San Jose Japantown as well as the Japanese American Museum of San Jose (JAMsj). We will survey Japanese Americans about their thoughts on JAMsj and if they want the museum to improve upon representing the entire Japanese American narrative. Our hope is that Japanese Americans will feel free to anonymously and openly express their thoughts, thus allowing the museum to understand the community’s priorities in preserving memory and improve its representation of the Japanese American narrative. With this project, JAMsj will be able to have a better grasp on what it is that will help them to improve their exhibitions and displays in their museum to encompass Japanese American history, memories, and identity. Our online survey will also provide JAMsj a tool that allows the neighborhood’s Japanese American community to share core memories about their community involvement that contributed to forming their JA identities. By creating an online tour and archiving their memories, we can uplift the experiences and memories of Japanese Americans, which have been suppressed by society and were not always highlighted within the community due to historical efforts of assimilation. 
## Who is being Empowered?
The local Japanese Americans are being empowered by this website. This website's main purpose is to uplift the local Japanese American narrative and to figure out what they think is missing from the musuem. Therefore, as JAMsj is able to figure out what is missing from the musuem through this website, they are able to make changes to this exhibits corresponding to concerns from local Japanese Americans.

## Future Uses
JAMsj can deepen their understanding of what they can do to better represent the narrative of the Japanese American in the museum, and to better accommodate the needs of members of the museum. The public can also look at some core memories associated within the neighborhood, leading to a deeper understanding of the general area
## Technology Stacks
Maplibre Gl JS, Javascript, HTML, CSS, GeoJSON, Google Sheets, Google Forms

This mapplication is a web-based tool inspired by JAMsj, to showcase the opinions and experiences of Japanese Americans from the local area and showcase their stories onto an interactive map. The site was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and the data was based on responses from an online Google Form that was sent out to JAMsj, and is also linked onto our website. MapLibre was used to visualize Japanese Americans' reponses on a map which allows users to explore whether or not Japanese Americans think JAMsj is succesful in capturing all details of Japanese American history and identity. Ultimately, this website allows JAMsj to clearly see people's opinions on their musuem, as well as what people think needs to be added to the musuem in order to become a more inclusive musuem.

## How Can it be Repurposed?
We plan to give shared ownership to JAMsj, a reliable organization which is actively involved in our community. Through this data, these organizations can deepen their understanding of what they can do to better represent the narrative of the Japanese American in the museum, and to better accommodate the needs of members of the museum. 
Furthermore, through creating a memory based tour as the organization requested, they will be able to better represent the neighborhood. Organizations will be able to add more data as they wish onto the maps to further capture details about their neighborhoods. 

## Features of the Website
As you first visit the website, users will see a modal that users can click out that briefly explains the main objectives of this website. On the left side of the website, it contains a pie chart that visualizes people's reponses to whether or not they think JAMsj is succesful in capturing the full Japanese American experience. This website also features colorcoded buttons with each color representing people's response to the same question as the pie chart. Users can press the button and the map will automatically center itself to the corresponding marker. Users can click on the map to find people's full response to the google form, featuring questions like generation, age, local memories, etc. The website also contains a legend for the markers, with the corresponding marker design indicating a person's reponse to whether or not they think JAMsj is succesful in capturing the full Japanese American experience. Lastly, if the user wishes to add their own experience to this website, they can simply click the link that says "Share Your Experience with JAMsj" and the website will automatically update itself to include the user's response!
